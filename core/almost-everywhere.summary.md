An ultrafilter on a set X is a maximal collection F of subsets of X such that: A property P of points in X holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter F, if the set of points for which P holds is in F. For example, one construction of the hyperreal number system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter. If ( X , Σ , μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a measure space, a property P {\displaystyle P} is said to hold almost everywhere in X {\displaystyle X} if there exists a set N ∈ Σ {\displaystyle N\in \Sigma } with μ ( N ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (N)=0} , and all x ∈ X ∖ N {\displaystyle x\in X\setminus N} have the property P {\displaystyle P} . More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if it holds for all elements in a set except a subset of measure zero, or equivalently, if the set of elements for which the property holds is conull.
