    "phrase": "What kind of risk is present when anxiety is generated need not be part of the content of one’s emotional experience for anxiety to function in the way that it does.In this section, I apply this picture of anxiety and risk to the epistemic realm, arguing that epistemic anxiety is an emotional response to epistemic risk: the risk of believing in error. In this case, the formal object of my emotional experience is epistemic risk, and its material object is the event of forming a false belief that my ticket is a loser.Like anxiety in general, epistemic anxiety will track normic and probabilistic epistemic risk, though its representational content won’t be so precise: when one experiences epistemic anxiety, one’s cognitive situation is simply represented to one as epistemically risky. One’s forming or holding a belief is probabilistically epistemically risky if it is likely, given one’s evidence, that the belief one would thereby come to have would be false;Footnote 11 it is modally epistemically risky if, holding fixed initial conditions, there are close worlds where the belief is false; and it is normically epistemically risky if there are normal worlds, relative to one’s evidence, in which the belief is false.I propose that epistemic anxiety is to epistemic risk as anxiety in general is to risk."
