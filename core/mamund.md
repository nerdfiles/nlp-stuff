Fielding used the the message-passing paradigm to help codify the essentials of in his REST style description.While the roots of the WWW are steeped in the idea of enabling state transitions via message-passing, that’s not how most developers approach the task of ‘programming the Web.’ Instead, as evidenced by the popularity of the MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) and related patterns.It’s common for Web developers to define an object model (including hierarchies) and then require both the client apps and the server-side services share the exact same object model. Requests were, at first, simple messages with an instruction and an address:This message was then interpreted by the receiver which retreived the requested data and returned that data in the form of another message:As the Web grew more sophisticated, both the request and response messages expanded to include a simple name/value pair to carry metadata and additional formats for expressing request variables and/or parameters to pass when writing data to the server. This is a late draft of an article published by DevX in 2015.While doing some background research on distributed software recently, I rediscovered some of the history of two major themes that affect many developers today: the Object-Oriented programming style (OOP [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming]) and Representational State Transfer architectural style (REST [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm]).
